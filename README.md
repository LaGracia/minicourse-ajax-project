## Description

This is a Udacity minicourse project for Intro to AJAX. This unit provides practice for working with APIs. The quizzes involve the construction of a web page called “Your Moving Companion.”

### Project details

The [page](http://lagracia.github.io/minicourse-ajax-project/) starts with only two input fields on a relatively blank page. The script that powers the page is written in the more concise jQuery instead of JavaScript.

When a user enters a street address and its city into the input boxes, AJAX requests are sent to Google, The New York Times, and Wikipedia via their APIs. The three sites respond to these requests by returning images and text to be displayed on the page.

### Credits

As always, I completed this project mainly by learning from others in the Udacity discussion forum, so thanks to all who posted questions and answered them there.

### License

I do not own the page created by Udacity, but my work on it is licensed under [GitHub’s terms of service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/), meaning you can view and fork this repository.
